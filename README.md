### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wira, currently a 2nd year undergraduate at National University of Singapore (NUS), pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) (Computer Engineering).

I'm interested in solving problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Duke, a CLI Software Engineering Project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Real-Time Operating Systems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Software Development projects to apply what I have learnt.
