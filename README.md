## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wira, a final year undergraduate at National University of Singapore (NUS), pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) (Computer Engineering). I am interested in research into Reinforcement Learning, as well as its broader application into real products such as autonomous vehicles.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving Multi-Agent Strategy Learning in Reinforcement Learning.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Hardware AI component of a Computer Engineering Capstone project implementing Laser Tag.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about [AI Planning & Decision Making](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS4246/ai-planning-and-decision-making), [Uncertainty Modelling in AI](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS5340/uncertainty-modelling-in-ai), and the [Internet of Things](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS3237/introduction-to-internet-of-things).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting into graduate school!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience as a Teaching Assistant!

## Current Projects

- Multi-agent strategy learning in reinforcement learning, as part of my Final Year Project.
