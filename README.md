### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wira, currently a 2nd year undergraduate at National University of Singapore (NUS), pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) (Computer Engineering).

I'm interested in solving puzzles.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Signals & Systems, Transistor-Level Digital Circuits, Computer Organization, Information Security, Design & Analysis of Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Computer Networks.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Software Development projects to apply what I have learnt.

### Past Projects

- [Fake News Detection](https://github.com/CS3244-MachineLearning-Project-AY2021/Fake_News_Detection/blob/master/Detection_of_Fake_News_Using_Supervised_Learning_Techniques.pdf), to detect fake news with known machine learning models, algorithms, and techniques. 
- [CLIrcuit Assistant](https://ay2021s1-cs2113t-w13-3.github.io/tp/), a desktop app to implement and solve simple circuits, optimized for use via the Command Line Interface (CLI).
- [RTOS-based robotic car](https://github.com/hughjazzman/CG2271), using a FRDM-KL25Z with Keil RTX, controlled via an Android App.
- [Knewbie](https://github.com/Orbital-Knewbie/Knewbie), a Web Application that is built using Flask and makes use of machine learning (Computerized Adaptive Testing) to provide tailored educational content.
  - From a total of 383 projects, Knewbie was 1 of 6 projects selected by the School of Computing (SoC) communication office, National University of Singapore (NUS) and was [featured on the various social media accounts](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6703488818370215936/).
- [Sound Design & Entertainment System](https://github.com/hughjazzman/EE2026-FPGA-Project), using Verilog on a Basys3 Board.
- [Alex](https://github.com/hughjazzman/alex-4-1-2), a Search and Rescue robot with remote navigation built using Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
- [mBot](https://github.com/hughjazzman/mBot), a robot calibrated to navigate a maze automatically based on audiovisual cues using Arduino.
